To view the .cpp and .h files for this project click the folder named "Pad"

This project is made with Windows Forms and if you wish to run it click the setup.exe in the main folder. This will install the program and put it on your Desktop.
Do not worry, if you click the setup.exe again you have the option to uninstall it.

There is also a "Pad.exe" located in the Debug folder. This runs on my computer but I doubt it will on anyone else's as the program was compiled on my computer. 


This program can read and computer any mathematical expression that uses "()+-*/".
This program also supports numbers that are more than one digit: ex: 124*3+(5/4-2)
This program will initially read its input from C:\temp\input.txt
The user also has the option to change and modify the input in the program.
